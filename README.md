Dataloop-agent Puppet Module
============================
This is a puppet module that installs the dataloop-agent on a host. It makes use of the puppetlabs apt module and the dataloop.io public yum and apt repositories.

Requirements
------------
* Tested on puppet 3.7.3
* Puppetlabs-apt module

Platforms
---------
* Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04, 140.4
* Rhel/Centos >= 6

Usage
-----
If you don't already have it, import the puppetlabs-apt module to your puppet repository

`#> puppet module install puppetlabs-apt --version 1.7.0`

And import this dataloop-agent module

`#> puppet module install --module_repository https://github.com/dataloop/dataloop-puppet dataloop-agent`

Add the dataloop-agent module to your node's run list and pass in the api_key for your dataloop.io account so that your servers can communicate back.

```
class { 'dataloop_agent': 
  api_key => 'fa970ce7-de56-4b98-915f-bb7d828c68d2'
}
```

Tags
---
After the agent has run once (to generate a fingerprint) you can run the following command to add tags.

```
#> /usr/bin/dataloop-agent -a [api key] -s https://www.dataloop.io --add-tags [tag1,tag2,tag3]
```

You can sprinkle these around your various modules so that dataloop dynamically updates on puppet runs. You can also use --remove-tags to take tags away.

Add an array on hiera called `dataloop_agent::tags` and these tags will be used instead for the specific role.
Eg `role.myhierafile.yaml`:
```
dataloop_agent::tags:
  - all
  - datacentre
  - mycustommachine
```
The list of tags that are used can be found in `/etc/dataloop/tags.conf`

Testing
-------
Testing for this module has been setup with Librarian-puppet and Test-Kitchen utilising vagrant as the machine provider.

Clone the repository, install the Gems (gem file to come), update the api_key in _manifests/test_site.pp_ and run kitchen test.

```
#> bundle install
#> kitchen test
```
